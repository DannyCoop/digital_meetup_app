# Digital Meetup

DigitalMeetup is an app that serves as a middle man for people intersted in planing digital meetups in this new quarantine life style of ours. Such as planing a movie night, a game night, or even just a group call. Users can see all of the the events posted and the people attending as well as the number of spots left. Users have an account where they can see a list of movies they are hosting, attending, or movies they've hosted or attend, edit or delete.
